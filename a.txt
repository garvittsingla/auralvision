You are looking down at a table where two people are working. A laptop is open, with hands on the keyboard. A smartphone and some papers are also on the table. Directly in front, there's a black board or poster with big white letters saying "OUR PROJECT". To the right, there is another item with a symbol partly visible. It seems like a meeting or session focused on a project. The document content is "OUR PROJECT".
